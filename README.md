# Password Generator Starter Code
THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE PASSWORD GENERATOR WITH STRUCTURE BUILT WITH HTML, DESIGN BY CSS, AND LOGIC BY JAVASCRIPT!

SIMPLY ENTER HOW LONG YOU WANT YOUR PASSWORD TO BE, 
CONFIRM IF YOU'D LIKE : lowercase letters, UPPERCASE LETTERS, numbers, or symbols!

- ONCE CONFIRMED, A PASSWORD BASED ON YOUR ANSWERS WILL BE GENERATED!

IT IS GOOD TO KNOW THAT YOU CAN NOT PUT ANYTHING OTHER THAN NUMBERS (INTEGERS) BETWEEN

8 AND 128 INSIDE OF THE PROMPT!

IT IS ALSO GOOD TO KNOW THAT YOU MUST SELECT ONE OF THE SPECIFIC CHOICES PROMPTED AFTER

THE LENGTH, IF NOT, YOU WILL RETURN BACK TO THE 'LOWERCASE' PROMPT UNTIL YOU GIVE THE 

LOGIC AN ARRAY OF CODE TO WORK WITH!
